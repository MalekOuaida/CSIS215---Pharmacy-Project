- The code defines a new class called Prescription that extends the Medicine class.
- Prescription class has a private instance variable called doctorSpecialization which is a string.
- The Prescription class has three constructors: a default constructor and two parameterized constructors.
- The default constructor of the Prescription class calls the default constructor of the parent class
"Medicine" using the super() method.
- The first parameterized constructor of the Prescription class takes four arguments:
name, composition, dose, and doctorSpecialization.
This constructor calls the second constructor of the parent class "Medicine" using the super() method
and sets the doctor specialization.
- The second parameterized constructor of the Prescription class takes six arguments:
name, composition, dose, quantity, price, and doctorSpecialization.
- This constructor calls the third constructor of the parent class "Medicine" using the super()
method and sets the doctor specialization.
- The Prescription class has a getter method for the doctorSpecialization instance variable.
- The Prescription class has a setter method for the doctorSpecialization instance variable.
The Prescription class overrides the toString() method of the Medicine class.
The new toString() method returns a string representation of the Prescription,
including information about the Medicine using the toString in the Parent Class "Medicine"
and adds the doctor's specialization.
