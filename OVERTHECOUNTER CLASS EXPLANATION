- This code defines a class named "OverTheCounter" which extends the "Medicine" class.
- The "OverTheCounter" class contains two private fields: "minAge" of type integer and two constructors.
- The first constructor is a default constructor that calls the default constructor of the "Medicine" class using the
"super()" method and sets the value of "minAge" to 18.
- The second constructor takes four arguments: "name", "composition", "dose", and "minAge".
It calls the constructor of the "Medicine" class that takes three arguments using the "super()" method
and sets the value of "minAge" to the value passed in as an argument.
- The third constructor takes six arguments: "name", "composition", "dose", "quantity", "price", and "minAge".
It calls the constructor of the "Medicine" class that takes five arguments using the "super()" method
and sets the value of "minAge" to the value passed in as an argument.
- The class also has a getter and setter method for "minAge".
- Finally, the class overrides the "toString()" method of the "Medicine" class to return a string representation
of the "OverTheCounter" object, including the "toString()" method of the "Medicine"
class and the value of the "minAge" variable.
