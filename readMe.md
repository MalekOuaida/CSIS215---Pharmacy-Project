# Pharmacy Management System

Welcome to my first object-oriented programming (OOP) class project - a Java-based Pharmacy Management System. This project was designed as an introduction to OOP concepts and showcases the implementation of a system to streamline the handling of medicines, prescriptions, and over-the-counter products in a pharmacy setting.

## Project Introduction

As my first foray into OOP during my studies, this project holds a special place in my academic journey. It was developed with the goal of applying theoretical OOP concepts in a practical, real-world application. This system reflects my initial understanding and application of Java programming, demonstrating my growth in software development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into multiple Java classes, each representing a different aspect of the pharmacy management system:

- `Main.java`: The main driver class for the application.
- `Medicine.java`: Represents the medicine entity.
- `Prescription.java`: Handles prescription-related functionalities.
- `OverTheCounter.java`: Manages over-the-counter products.
- `Pharmacy.java`: Core class for pharmacy operations.

Each class file is accompanied by a detailed explanation file that describes its purpose and functionality.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to start the application.

## Features

- **Medicine Management**: Add, update, and track medicines.
- **Prescription Handling**: Process and manage prescriptions.
- **Over-The-Counter Sales**: Manage over-the-counter sales and inventory.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports for inventory, sales, and prescriptions.

## Contributing

As this project was my first OOP class assignment, I am keen to learn from the community. Contributions that enhance functionality or efficiency are highly appreciated. Please feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request.
